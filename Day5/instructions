Create a new Python file in this package(Day5).
Create a list of words for the game.
Use the import statement to import the random module.
Use the random.choice() function to choose a random word from the list.
Define variables to keep track of the hidden word and the guessed letters.
Define a loop that allows the user to keep guessing until they guess all the letters in the word or run out of attempts.
Give the user feedback after each guess (e.g. "Correct letter", "Incorrect letter", "You win!", "You lose.").
Run the program to make sure it works correctly.

I've worked out about 6 days worth of assignments for you, each tougher than the one before.
I don't expect that all of them should be completed, though you certainly
should try! Remember to commit and push your code to the repository EVERY
TIME you finish working, whether you are completely finished with the code
or not. I haven't included step by step instructions for everything I've
asked you to do here -- some of it, you'll have to research(have Dad help
with the harder parts!) If you have questions about specific parts of the
problem, leave me a block of comment code at the bottom of the file to let
me know. To leave block comments, you use triple quote marks with one above
your comment block, one below your comment block. You could also copy and
paste this and remove all my text and replace it with your own. Good Luck!

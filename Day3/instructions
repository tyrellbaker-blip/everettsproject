Day 3: Guessing Game
Create a new Python file in this package(Day3).
Use the import statement to import the random module.
Use the random.randint() function to generate a random number between 1 and 10.
Use the input() function to ask the user to guess the number.
Define a loop that allows the user to keep guessing until they get the correct number or run out of attempts.
Give the user feedback after each guess (e.g. "Too high", "Too low", "Correct!").
Run the program to make sure it works correctly.
